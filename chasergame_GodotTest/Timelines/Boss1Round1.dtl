- Reason
	Imeris (Group/ImerisNeutral): We were damned long before I chose this path.
	Imeris: Fighting me will not save you. You merely toil in the name of our cagers.
	Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): Lies... Lies!!!
	Linnaeus: I was blessed! The Queen herself bestowed her favor on me!!!
	Linnaeus: My life was one of ease, because of her mercy!
	Linnaeus: And because of you, I will never get it back!!!
	- Stand
		Imeris (Group/ImerisAngry): I am not afraid of you.
		(Linnaeus is enraged.)
		Linnaeus (Group/LinNeutral): Oh?
		Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): Don't worry. You will be.
		Narrator: (Next attack will be faster)

	- Cower
		Narrator: (Linnaeus sees your fear. He smiles cruelly.)
		Linnaeus (Group/LinNeutral): Are you frightened?
		Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): Good. You should be.
		Narrator: (Next attack will be slower)

- Apologize
	Imeris (Group/ImerisNeutral): I'm sorry. I had to do this. I could not live any other way.
	Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): What good does that pathetic apology do?
	Linnaeus: Do you not see the devastation you've wrought?
	Linnaeus: Your sinfulness cannot be washed away with mere words!
	- Refute
		Imeris (Group/ImerisAngry): I am NOT sinful.
		Imeris: You, of all people, do not get to say that to me.
		Imeris: I am becoming who the Goddess made me to be.
		(Linnaeus is enraged.)
		Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): You could never begin to know Her will, wretch.
		Linnaeus: I shall not let this insult stand.
		Narrator: (Next attack will be faster.)

	- Apologize
		Imeris (Group/ImerisNeutral): ...I'm sorry.
		Narrator: (Linnaeus looks at you with contempt, but also pity.)
		Narrator: (He says nothing, but his grip eases.)
		Narrator: (Next attack will be slower.)

- Denounce
	Imeris (Group/ImerisNeutral): You never saw the truth of Her teachings, in all your yearsâ€¦ how pitiful.
	Narrator: (Linnaeus is enraged.)
	Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): No, it is YOU who does not see!
	Linnaeus: That one of my own children would have the gall to condescend to me in this way...
	Linnaeus: My mercy ends here.
	Linnaeus: (Next attack will be faster.)
	- Accept
		Imeris (Group/ImerisAngry): If all that came before this was your mercy, then I am happy to do without it.
		Linnaeus (Group/LinNeutral): ...Then so be it.

	- Flinch
		Narrator: (Linnaeus sees your stricken response. He smiles cruelly.)
		Linnaeus (Group/LinNeutral): Oh, are you frightened, heretic? You should be.
		Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): Even if you make it out of this room, you'll never outrun your sin.
		Linnaeus: It will follow you forever, like the very wings upon your back.

- Pacify
	Imeris (Group/ImerisNeutral): Why do you despair, Father?
	Imeris: I have done naught but follow Our Lady's word. Surely there is peace for us all at the end of Her path.
	Narrator: Linnaeus laughs bitterly.
	Linnaeus (Group/LinNeutral): There is no way out of this, you fool. For any of us.
	Linnaeus: But at least you have maintained some scrap of piety. I mustn't have failed so utterly, then.
	Narrator: (Next attack will be slower)
	- Argue
		Imeris (Group/ImerisAngry): I am no sinner. Our Lady guides me; I mold myself in Her image.
		Imeris: My body is all the more holy for what I have done.
		Imeris: If you wish to remain here, unchanged, and perish, then so be it. But I will not die with you.
		(Linnaeus is enraged.)
		Linnaeus (Group/LinAngry): Who are you to tell me what Our Lady wishes for us?
		Linnaeus: Open your eyes to the truth!
		set {currentRound} += 1
		[signal arg="EnemyTurn"]
	- Acquiesce
		Imeris (Group/ImerisNeutral): You may be right. Perhaps I only seek to pervert myself, at the expense of others.
		Imeris: But now that I have started, I cannot stop. I must let myself out of the shell of this body.
		Linnaeus (Group/LinNeutral): ...
		Linnaeus: So be it.
